# Question

What does the `__dirname` environment variable return?

# Answer

`__dirname` is a variable that gives the absolute path of the directory where the current file is located (AKA where you are currently cd'ed into). Very helpful for creating paths to other folders and files without having to type the full name of your current directory.
