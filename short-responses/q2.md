# Question

What does the `__dirname` environment variable return?

# Answer

`__dirname` is a variable that gives the absolute path of the directory where the current file is located (AKA where you are currently cd'ed into). Very helpful for creating paths to other folders and files without having to type the full name of your current directory.

Great job! Love that you mentioned the not having to type the full name of the current directory, on a similar note, if you are working with other developers, their directory string will probably look different. By using this variable we create a dynamic connection from our backend to our frontend.
