# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
Middleware and controllers both handle requests in Express, but middleware often won't send a response back to the client. Instead it's used for processing and passing on data to the next middleware or controller. Controllers are usually the last stop in this chain, sending a response back.
