# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer

Static assets are our files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts, that don't change and are served to clients exactly as stored on the server. With React, you generate static assets by running `npm run build`, which bundles the code into optimized files in a folder (dist or build) that can be used by a server.
